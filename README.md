## Background & Purpose

**Yet Another M* Platform (YAMP)** is an independent, nonprofit, third-party modding project focused on delivering high-quality multiplayer experiences driven by its community.

Recently, the YAMP team publicly shared that they received a formal **Cease & Desist** notice from **Take-Two Interactive**. Following this, the project’s developers decided to temporarily pause development while engaging in good-faith communication to seek clarification and explore a possible resolution that respects all parties involved.

Throughout its existence, YAMP has remained **free and non-commercial**, with no monetization or donation systems, in line with its nonprofit principles. The team has consistently emphasized transparency and community-driven development.

This project, **freeyamp.github.io**, was created as a **community support and awareness initiative**. Its sole purpose is to allow supporters to add a **#FREEYAMP** overlay to images in order to express solidarity with the YAMP community and highlight the importance of open dialogue around modding, creativity, and community-driven projects.

This repository is **not affiliated with Take-Two Interactive or Rockstar Games**, and it does not host, distribute, or modify any game files. It is a fan-made, informational tool created to support community expression.
